            *	Produced a series of reinforcement learning algorithms in Python to efficiently identify the optimal characteristics of prime membership advertisements through strategic sequential testing
            *	Adapted these models to complex data settings, including sparse signals and heteroskedastic noise
            *	Created realistic simulation structures to test best-advertisement identification algorithms (“best-arm identification” in the multi-armed bandit literature) against A/B testing and other competitors in high-dimensional data contexts

          description: |2-
              * Designed a  reinforcement learning algorithm to better select advertisements sourced by a variety of machine learning algorithms using query features and partially observed customer behavior signals
              * Implemented the infrastructure for evaluating the advantages of modifications to advertisement sourcing algorithms on downstream outcomes in Spark
              * Ran off-line experiments testing the utility of my algorithm over a week of Amazon search query traffic and found that it was consistently capturing more than 3% of the high-quality ads missed by the current method
