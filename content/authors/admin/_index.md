I'm Justin, a Phd student at Duke University under the supervision of [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/) and [Eric Laber](https://www.laber-labs.com/) . I create methods for the study and assistance of hard-to-reach populations. In recent news:

- I will be giving an invited talk at JSM 2024 on Reinforcement learning respondent driven sampling.
- My paper [Hidden population estimation with auxiliary information](uploads/HidPopEst.pdf) was submitted to AISTATS 2024.
- My paper [Experimental designs for heteroskedastic variance](uploads/experimental_designs_for_heter.pdf) was accepted to NeurIPS 2023.
